o Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to get insight of each variable of vine dataset.

o Checked for all the assumptions for the model and transformed some variables to match required assumptions.

o Applied stepwise linear regression to predict accurate red vine quality.

o Separated data to test and train with 75:25 split ration to improve model performance.

o Achieved r-squared of 0.87 which means model predicted at accuracy of 87%.
